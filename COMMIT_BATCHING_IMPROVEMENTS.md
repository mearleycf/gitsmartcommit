# Commit Batching Improvements

## Problem Statement

The git-smart-commit tool was creating single large commits instead of properly batching separate units of work into separate commits. For example, when updating documentation for multiple features, it would create one commit like:

```text
docs(documentation): update documentation
Files: README.md, ai_instructions.md, current_status.md, project_history.md, suggestions.md, web/README.md, .kiro/specs/budget-management/design.md, .kiro/specs/budget-management/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/budget-management/tasks.md, .kiro/specs/business-expense-tracking/design.md, .kiro/specs/business-expense-tracking/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/business-expense-tracking/tasks.md, .kiro/specs/income-forecasting/design.md, .kiro/specs/income-forecasting/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/income-forecasting/tasks.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-data-ingestion/design.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-data-ingestion/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-data-ingestion/tasks.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-reconciliation/design.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-reconciliation/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-reconciliation/tasks.md, ai_context_guide.md
```

Instead of creating separate commits for each logical unit of work.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the relationship analysis logic in `gitsmartcommit/core.py`. The AI model was not properly grouping files into logical units and was instead grouping all files together into a single commit unit.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Relationship Analysis Prompt

**File: `gitsmartcommit/prompts.py`**

Improved the `RELATIONSHIP_PROMPT` to be more specific about grouping files into logical units:

- Added explicit instructions to create MULTIPLE groups when files represent different logical units
- Provided clear examples of proper vs. bad grouping
- Emphasized that different features should be in separate groups, even if they're all documentation
- Added guidance to look for patterns in file paths that indicate feature boundaries

### 2. Fallback Pattern-Based Grouping

**File: `gitsmartcommit/core.py`**

Added intelligent fallback grouping when the AI fails to create proper logical units:

#### `_fallback_grouping()` Method

- Groups files by patterns: main docs, web docs, feature specs, and other files
- Handles root-level documentation files properly (distinguishes between `README.md` and `web/README.md`)
- Groups feature specifications by feature name (e.g., all `.kiro/specs/budget-management/*` files together)
- Creates separate groups for different features

#### `_granular_fallback_grouping()` Method

- Provides more granular grouping for complex directory structures
- Groups files by directory structure (e.g., `src/auth/*` files together)
- Handles edge cases and unknown file patterns

### 3. Automatic Fallback Detection

**File: `gitsmartcommit/core.py`**

Added logic to automatically detect when the AI has failed to create proper logical units:

```python
# Check if the AI created proper logical grouping
# If all files are in one group, use fallback pattern-based grouping
if len(grouping_result.groups) == 1 and len(grouping_result.groups[0]) > 3:
    print("Warning: AI grouped all files together. Using fallback pattern-based grouping...")
    grouping_result = self._fallback_grouping(changes)
```

## Expected Behavior

With these improvements, the tool should now create separate commits like:

1. **docs(main): update main project documentation**
   - Files: README.md, ai_instructions.md, current_status.md, project_history.md, suggestions.md, ai_context_guide.md

2. **docs(web): update web documentation**
   - Files: web/README.md

3. **docs(budget): update budget management specifications**
   - Files: .kiro/specs/budget-management/design.md, .kiro/specs/budget-management/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/budget-management/tasks.md

4. **docs(expenses): update business expense tracking specifications**
   - Files: .kiro/specs/business-expense-tracking/design.md, .kiro/specs/business-expense-tracking/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/business-expense-tracking/tasks.md

5. **docs(forecasting): update income forecasting specifications**
   - Files: .kiro/specs/income-forecasting/design.md, .kiro/specs/income-forecasting/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/income-forecasting/tasks.md

6. **docs(ingestion): update transaction data ingestion specifications**
   - Files: .kiro/specs/transaction-data-ingestion/design.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-data-ingestion/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-data-ingestion/tasks.md

7. **docs(reconciliation): update transaction reconciliation specifications**
   - Files: .kiro/specs/transaction-reconciliation/design.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-reconciliation/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/transaction-reconciliation/tasks.md

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests in `tests/test_batching.py` to verify:

- Basic fallback grouping functionality
- Granular fallback grouping for complex directory structures
- Pattern-based grouping for various file types
- Edge cases (empty changes, single files, unknown patterns)

All tests are passing and verify that the fallback grouping works correctly.

## Benefits

1. **Better Commit History**: More granular commits make it easier to understand what changes were made
2. **Improved Code Review**: Reviewers can focus on specific features rather than large mixed commits
3. **Easier Rollbacks**: Can rollback specific features without affecting others
4. **Better Git Blame**: More accurate attribution of changes to specific features
5. **Robust Fallback**: Even if the AI fails, the tool will still create logical groupings

## Usage

The improvements are automatic and require no changes to how you use the tool. Simply run:

```bash
git-smart-commit
```

The tool will now automatically detect when files should be grouped into separate commits and create multiple commits accordingly.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The fallback grouping is enabled by default and will automatically activate when the AI fails to create proper logical units.

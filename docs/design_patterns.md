# Design Patterns in GitSmartCommit

This document outlines the design patterns used in GitSmartCommit and explains how they help improve the codebase's structure and maintainability.

## 1. Strategy Pattern

### Purpose
The Strategy Pattern allows us to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Implementation
- Location: `gitsmartcommit/commit_message.py`
- Key Components:
  - `CommitMessageStrategy` (Abstract Strategy)
  - `SimpleCommitStrategy` (Concrete Strategy)
  - `ConventionalCommitStrategy` (Concrete Strategy)
  - `CommitMessageGenerator` (Context)

### Benefits
- Allows easy addition of new commit message generation strategies
- Makes it simple to switch between different commit message formats
- Facilitates testing by allowing mock strategies

## 2. Observer Pattern

### Purpose
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Implementation
- Location: `gitsmartcommit/observers.py`
- Key Components:
  - `GitOperationObserver` (Observer Interface)
  - `FileLogObserver` (Concrete Observer)
  - `GitCommitter` (Subject)

### Benefits
- Decouples git operations from their side effects
- Makes it easy to add new observers for logging, notifications, etc.
- Improves testability by allowing mock observers

## 3. Factory Pattern

### Purpose
The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Implementation
- Location: `gitsmartcommit/factories.py`
- Key Components:
  - `AgentFactory` (Abstract Factory)
  - `ClaudeAgentFactory` (Concrete Factory)
  - `MockAgentFactory` (Concrete Factory for Testing)

### Benefits
- Centralizes object creation logic
- Makes it easy to switch between different AI models
- Facilitates testing by providing mock implementations

## 4. Chain of Responsibility Pattern

### Purpose
The Chain of Responsibility Pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a request. This pattern decouples sender and receiver objects.

### Implementation
- Location: `gitsmartcommit/commit_message/validation.py`
- Key Components:
  - `ValidationHandler` (Handler)
  - Various concrete handlers:
    - `EmptyMessageHandler`
    - `SubjectLengthHandler`
    - `SubjectPeriodHandler`
    - `ConventionalFormatHandler`
    - `BlankLineHandler`
    - `BodyLineLengthHandler`

### Benefits
- Makes it easy to add or remove validation rules
- Each validation rule is encapsulated in its own class
- Rules can be reordered or conditionally included

## 5. Command Pattern

### Purpose
The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

### Implementation
- Location: `gitsmartcommit/commands.py`
- Key Components:
  - `GitCommand` (Command Interface)
  - `CommitCommand` (Concrete Command)
  - `PushCommand` (Concrete Command)
  - `GitCommitter` (Invoker)

### Benefits
- Supports undo operations for git commands
- Encapsulates all information needed to perform git operations
- Makes it easy to add new git operations
- Provides a history of executed commands
- Integrates with the Observer pattern for notifications

## Pattern Interactions

The patterns work together to create a flexible and maintainable system:

1. The Factory Pattern creates strategies and agents used throughout the system
2. The Strategy Pattern determines how commit messages are generated
3. The Chain of Responsibility validates commit messages
4. The Command Pattern executes git operations
5. The Observer Pattern notifies interested parties about git operations

## Adding New Features

When adding new features, consider using these patterns:

1. For new git operations:
   - Add a new Command class implementing `GitCommand`
   - Add appropriate tests in `tests/test_commands.py`

2. For new commit message formats:
   - Add a new Strategy implementing `CommitMessageStrategy`
   - Add appropriate tests in `tests/test_core.py`

3. For new validation rules:
   - Add a new Handler implementing `ValidationHandler`
   - Add appropriate tests in `tests/test_validation.py`

4. For new notifications:
   - Add a new Observer implementing `GitOperationObserver`
   - Add appropriate tests in `tests/test_core.py`

## Test Execution

To run all tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

To run specific test categories:
```bash
# Core functionality
python -m pytest tests/test_core.py -v

# Edge cases
python -m pytest tests/test_edge_cases.py -v

# Security tests
python -m pytest tests/test_security.py -v

# Performance tests
python -m pytest tests/test_performance.py -v

# Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
```

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD environments and includes:
- ✅ Fast unit tests for quick feedback
- ✅ Comprehensive integration tests for thorough validation
- ✅ Security tests for vulnerability detection
- ✅ Performance tests for regression detection
- ✅ Mock-based tests for reliable execution

## Conclusion

The test suite now provides comprehensive coverage of:
1. **Functionality**: All core features are tested
2. **Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios are handled gracefully
3. **Security**: Common attack vectors are prevented
4. **Performance**: Performance regressions are detected
5. **Integration**: End-to-end workflows are validated

This comprehensive test coverage should significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering errors when using the tool in other repositories.
